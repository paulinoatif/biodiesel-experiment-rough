    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>2030. The once vibrant hum of industry and the dazzling glow of city lights, has come to a halt. The world now lies in the shadow of its former self. Fossil fuel infrastructure is in total ruins, and supply chains are but a distant memory. Humankind finds itself at a crossroad, yet amidst the chaos, there is a subtle shimmer of hope. Imagine a fuel source that can be brewed from your backyard, using yesterday's cooking oil. Enter Biodiesel—a beacon of resilience, offering a lifeline to rebuild a world on the brink of renewal.</p>

    <h3>The Diesel Engine: A Versatile Platform</h3>
    <p>The late 19th century saw a rapid rise in industrialization, creating a demand for powerful, efficient engines for transportation and machinery. Diesel engines, invented based on the principle of compression ignition, operate at high temperature and compression ratios. This allows for increased torque available at lower RPMs and superior thermal efficiency compared to gasoline engines. Their robust design has made them the go-to choice for industrial applications, transportation, and agriculture.</p>

    <h3>Biodiesel: A Simple and Sustainable Alternative</h3>
    <p>There are two primary types of biofuels as diesel alternatives: Renewable Diesel and Biodiesel. Both are recognized as potential alternatives to petroleum-based diesel, sourced from vegetable and seed oils. Renewable Diesel production uses a hydrotreating process to remove oxygen from the fats and oils, while biodiesel is produced by a less complex transesterification process and retains some oxygen.</p>

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <h3>Feedstock Preparation</h3>
    <p>Waste vegetable oil (WVO) was collected and allowed to settle, separating clear oil from contaminants. The oil was then heated to 65°C using a makeshift fire pit constructed from salvaged bricks.</p>

    <h3>Catalyst Preparation</h3>
    <p>Sodium hydroxide (lye) was extracted from wood ash by leaching with water and subsequent evaporation. The resulting alkali was titrated to determine its concentration.</p>

    <h3>Alcohol Production</h3>
    <p>Ethanol was produced through the fermentation and distillation of carbohydrate-rich plant matter, primarily corn and fruit waste.</p>

    <h3>Transesterification Process</h3>
    <p>Transesterification is the cornerstone of biodiesel production. This process involves the reaction of triglycerides (the main component of vegetable oils and animal fats) with a short-chain alcohol in the presence of a catalyst.</p>

    <h3>Separation and Purification</h3>
    <p>The reaction mixture was allowed to settle in a modified 5-gallon polycarbonate jug equipped with a drain valve. After separation, the glycerol byproduct was drained, and the crude biodiesel underwent a water washing process to remove impurities.</p>

    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Biodiesel Production from Waste Vegetable Oil</h1>

        <h2>1. Feedstock Preparation</h2>

        <h3>1.1 Collecting and Filtering WVO</h3>
        <p>Proper filtration of WVO is essential to remove food particles and contaminants that could interfere with the chemical reaction.</p>
        <h4>Materials needed:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Waste Vegetable Oil (WVO)</li>
            <li>Large clear containers (e.g., clean 5-gallon food-grade buckets)</li>
            <li>Fine mesh filter or old cotton t-shirts</li>
            <li>Funnel</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Procedure:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Collect WVO from local restaurants or cafeterias in clean, food-grade containers. Just ask them to save their cooking oil for you, and if they ask why, tell them you are on a secret mission to save humanity.</li>
            <li>Allow the oil to settle for 48-72 hours in a warm place.</li>
            <li>Carefully pour the top, clearer layer into another container, leaving sediment behind.</li>
            <li>Set up a filtration system using a funnel lined with a fine mesh filter or several layers of cotton t-shirt material.</li>
            <li>Slowly pour the oil through the filter to remove remaining particles.</li>
            <li>Repeat the filtration process if necessary until the oil appears clear and free of visible particles.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>1.2 Heating the WVO</h3>
        <h4>Materials needed:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Large metal pot or cauldron</li>
            <li>Thermometer (0-100°C range)</li>
            <li>Bricks or rocks for fire pit</li>
            <li>Heat-resistant gloves</li>
            <li>Fire extinguisher</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="safety">
            <h4>Safety precautions:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Work in a well-ventilated area to prevent the buildup of fumes.</li>
                <li>Keep a fire extinguisher nearby in case of emergencies.</li>
                <li>Wear heat-resistant gloves when handling hot containers.</li>
                <li>Monitor the temperature closely to prevent overheating and potential fire hazards.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h4>Procedure:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Construct a fire pit using bricks or rocks in a safe, outdoor area.</li>
            <li>Place the large metal pot on the fire pit.</li>
            <li>Fill the pot 2/3 full with filtered WVO.</li>
            <li>Build a fire under the pot using dry wood or other available fuel sources.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil to 65°C, constantly monitoring with the thermometer.</li>
            <li>If a thermometer is unavailable, heat until the oil is hot but not smoking (you should see faint ripples on the surface).</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Rationale for Heating</h3>
        <p>Heating the WVO to 65°C serves multiple purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Helps remove any remaining water in the oil through evaporation.</li>
            <li>Improves the efficiency of the transesterification reaction by reducing oil viscosity.</li>
            <li>Ensures that the reactants are at an optimal temperature for the chemical process.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>- I also enjoy the fire pit aesthetic.</p>

            <li>Personal protective equipment (gloves, goggles, apron)</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="safety">
            <h4>Safety precautions:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Always wear proper personal protective equipment when handling lye or lye solutions.</li>
                <li>Work in a well-ventilated area to avoid inhaling fumes.</li>
                <li>Have a source of running water or an emergency eyewash station nearby.</li>
                <li>Store lye and lye solutions in clearly labeled, airtight containers away from children and pets.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h4>Procedure:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a 5-gallon bucket 1/4 full with hardwood ash.</li>
            <li>Add water until the bucket is 3/4 full.</li>
            <li>Stir thoroughly with a stick for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let the mixture settle for 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Carefully pour the clear liquid (lye water) into another container.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Chemical reaction:</h4>
        <p>The main reaction occurring is:</p>
        <pre>K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (from wood ash) + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> (from water) → 2KOH + CaCO<sub>3</sub></pre>

        <h3>2.2 Evaporating to Obtain Crude Sodium Hydroxide</h3>
        <h4>Procedure:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour the lye water into a stainless steel pot.</li>
            <li>Heat on a stove or fire pit in a well-ventilated area (preferably outdoors).</li>
            <li>Simmer until the water evaporates, leaving a white residue.</li>
            <li><strong>CAUTION:</strong> Do not inhale the fumes. If you did and it makes you feel silly, please call 9-11. Wear protective gear if possible.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>2.3 Titration to Determine Catalyst Concentration</h3>
        <h4>Procedure:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Dissolve 1 gram of the crude sodium hydroxide in 1 liter of distilled water.</li>
            <li>In a small glass vial, mix 1 ml of your WVO with 10 ml of isopropyl alcohol.</li>
            <li>Add 2-3 drops of phenolphthalein indicator to the oil-alcohol mixture.</li>
            <li>Using an eyedropper, slowly add the sodium hydroxide solution to the vial.</li>
            <li>Stir after each drop until the mixture turns and remains pink for 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>Count the number of drops (or ml) added. This is your titration number.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Alternative methods:</h4>
        <p>If titration equipment is unavailable, you can use a standardized recipe based on the type and quality of oil. However, this may result in less efficient biodiesel production.</p>

        <h2>3. Alcohol Production</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Fermentation Process</h3>
        <h4>Materials needed:</h4>

                <li>Keep all heat sources away from the collection container of distilled alcohol.</li>
                <li>Never leave the distillation process unattended.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h4>Testing alcohol content:</h4>
        <p>If available, use an alcohol hydrometer to measure the ethanol concentration. Aim for at least 80% alcohol content for effective transesterification.</p>
        <h4>Alternative methods:</h4>
        <p>If distillation equipment is not available, consider using fermented beverages with high alcohol content or explore other sources of alcohol (e.g., medicinal alcohol).</p>

        <h2>5. Separation and Purification</h2>

        <h3>5.1 Separation of Biodiesel and Glycerol</h3>
        <h4>Materials needed:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>5-gallon bucket with a valve near the bottom</li>
            <li>Warm water</li>
            <li>Heat source for drying</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Procedure:</h4>

            <li>Transfer the reaction mixture to the modified 5-gallon bucket.</li>
            <li>Allow the mixture to settle for 12-24 hours. Two distinct layers should form.</li>
            <li>The bottom layer (darker, more viscous) is glycerol. Carefully drain this through the valve.</li>
            <li>The top layer is crude biodiesel.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>5.2 Washing and Drying Biodiesel</h3>
        <h4>Procedure:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Add warm water (about 1/3 the volume of biodiesel) to the bucket.</li>
            <li>Gently agitate to mix water and biodiesel without forming an emulsion.</li>
            <li>Let it settle for several hours. The water will sink, carrying impurities.</li>
            <li>Drain the bottom water layer through the valve.</li>
            <li>Repeat steps a-d 2-3 times until the drained water is clear.</li>
            <li>Heat the washed biodiesel to 100°C to evaporate any remaining water.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Storage</h3>
        <p>Store the purified biodiesel in clean, airtight containers away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures.</p>
    </div>

</html>

    <h2>Results and Discussion</h2>
    <p>The biodiesel produced through this rudimentary process was analyzed for key properties according to ASTM D6751 standards. The fuel exhibited a kinematic viscosity of 4.2 mm²/s at 40°C, within the specified range of 1.9-6.0 mm²/s. The cetane number was estimated at 52, exceeding the minimum requirement of 47. Flash point was measured at 150°C, well above the minimum 93°C threshold.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This study demonstrates the feasibility of small-scale biodiesel production using rudimentary equipment and locally sourced materials. The resulting fuel met key quality standards, suggesting its viability as an alternative to petroleum diesel in resource-scarce scenarios such as the 2030 collapse of America. The ability to produce biodiesel from waste vegetable oil using basic tools and processes offers a potential solution for maintaining essential transportation and power generation in post-apocalyptic or severely resource-constrained environments.</p>
